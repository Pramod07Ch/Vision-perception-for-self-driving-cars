# vision-perception-for-self-driving-cars
Coursera final project

In this Project assignment, how the output of semeantic segmentation is used to extract useful scene information to allow self-driving cars to safely and reliably traverse their moving environment.

The main tasks are:

- use the output of semantic segmentation from neural networks is used to implement drivable space estimation in 3D.
- and also to implement lane estimation.
- how the output of semantic segmentation is filtered without errors for the output of 2D object detectors.
- the filtered 2D object detection results to determine how far obstacles are from the self-driving car.
